As we are planning to move from India to Germany for our Second year of studies. I heard all sorts of horror stories about the rental market in Germany for students. The fact that searching for “How to find an apartment in Germany” on Google yields dozens of pages of advice is a good indicator that apartment hunting is a painful process.
Germany is cold, but finding an apartment in Essen or any other place we might end up after our graduation is scary. I read that landlords hold open houses, and that you have to bring all of your paperwork to the open house and be willing to put down a deposit immediately to even be considered.
As most apartment listings in Germany are originally on Craigslist, then scraped by the other sites, there’s also a fear that maybe not all the listings are scraped, or that they’re not scraped quickly enough to make the alerts real-time. So, I wanted
 a way
• • •
• •
to:
Get notified in near real-time when a posting was made to Craigslist. Filter out listings that didn’t fall into our desired neighbourhoods.
Filter out listings that didn’t match additional criteria, like proximity to public transit.
Collaborate on listings and rate them together.
Easily get in touch with the landlord for listings we liked.
